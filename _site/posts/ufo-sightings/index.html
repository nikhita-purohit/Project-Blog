<h1>6. <em>Summary of Findings</em></h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The USA has reported the most UFO sightings over the years, next being Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>Encounter duration with UFOs has remained almost the same over the years, with a few exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>UFO encounters in Great Britain tend to be the longest as compared to Australia, Canada and USA.</p></li>
<li><p>Duration of UFO encounters varies widely in USA, and very scarcely in Australia.</p></li>
<li><p>The most frequently sighted UFO Shape is ‘light’. This particularly shaped UFO was spotted in all four countries on varied days.</p></li>
<li><p>The lesser frequently sighted UFO Shapes include ‘changed’, ‘crescent’, ‘flare’, ‘hexagon’ and ‘pyramid’.</p></li>

<h1>7. <em>Surprising Aspects</em></h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why are there more UFOs spotted in USA? Could they be mistaking objects as UFOs?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the data set, there are UFO sightings that were documented only years after they were reported, which is very strange.</p></li>
<li><p>Duration of UFO encounters seem to be higher in the Northern countries.</p></li>
<li><p>I was unaware of the variety in shapes of UFOs that existed.</p></li>
