# Fertility

Studying Fertility Decisions

EXPERIMENT OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this experiment could be to understand the characteristics of women of different ethnicity, especially Hispanic and African American women, in order to study their fertility decisions.

## *1. Setting up R Packages*

```{r}
# SETUP CHUNK- LIBRARIES
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic) # Our all-in-one package
library(skimr) # Looking at data
library(janitor) # Clean the data
library(naniar) # Handle missing data
library(visdat) # Visualise missing data
library(tinytable) # Printing Static Tables for our data
library(DT) # Interactive Tables for our data
library(crosstable) # Multiple variable summaries
```

## 2. *Read Data*

```{r}
fertility_modified <- fertility <- readr::read_csv("../data/Fertility.csv")%>%
  # Clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names(case="snake")
fertility_modified
```

## 3. *Examine Data*

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(fertility_modified)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(fertility_modified)
```

```{r}
crosstable(work + age ~ hispanic + afam + other,
           data = fertility_modified
) %>%
    crosstable::as_flextable()
```

## 4. *Data Dictionary*

### *Quantitative Data*

1.  rownames(dbl): Number of observations
2.  age(dbl): Age of the mother (years)
3.  work(dbl): Number of hours worked in a week

### *Qualitative Data*

1.  morekids(fct): Does the mother want more kids? (yes or no)
2.  gender1(fct): Gender of the first born child
3.  gender2(fct): Gender of the second born child
4.  afam(fct): If the mother is African American (yes or no)
5.  hispanic(fct): If the mother is Hispanic (yes or no)
6.  other(fct): If the mother is neither African American nor Hispanic (yes or no)

```{r}
fertility_modified %>%
  dplyr::count(morekids,gender1,gender2,afam,hispanic,other) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
fertility_modified %>%
  dplyr::summarise(across(
    .cols = c(age,work), # select columns

    .fns = list(
      mean = ~ mean(., na.rm = T),
      sd = sd,
      min = min, max = max
    )
  ))
```

```{r}
fertility_modified <- fertility %>% tidyr::drop_na()
fertility_modified
```

```{r}
fertility_modified <- fertility %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) %>% 
  # arrange the Qual variables first, Quant next
  dplyr::relocate(where(is.factor), .after = rownames)

glimpse(fertility_modified)
```

```{r}

fertility_modified2 <- fertility_modified %>%
  stats::setNames(c("Row ID","Want More Kids","Gender of First Born","Gender of Second Born","African American","Hispanic","Other","Age","Work"))

fertility_modified2 %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 500) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    style = "default",
    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = "caption-side: top; text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 100%;", "Fertility Dataset (Clean)"
    ),
    options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  DT::formatStyle(
    columns = names(fertility_modified2),
    fontFamily = "Roboto Condensed",
    fontSize = "12px",
  )
```

# 5. *Graphs*

## 1. Which Ethnic Groups are More Likely to Want More Children?

```{r}
fertility_modified  %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 500) %>%
  dplyr::count(morekids,afam,hispanic,other) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
fertility_chunk <- tibble::tribble(
  ~morekids, ~afam, ~hispanic, ~other, ~n,
  "no",  "no",  "no",  "no",  270,
  "no",  "no",  "no",  "yes", 6,
  "no",  "no",  "yes", "no", 12,
  "no",  "no",  "yes", "yes", 7,
  "no",  "yes", "no",  "no", 18,
  "yes", "no",  "no",  "no", 155,
  "yes", "no",  "no",  "yes", 4,
  "yes", "no",  "yes", "no", 5,
  "yes", "no",  "yes", "yes", 8,
  "yes", "yes", "no", "no", 15
)

fertility_chunk_modified <- fertility_chunk %>%
  filter((afam == "yes" & hispanic == "no" & other == "no") |
         (afam == "no" & hispanic == "yes" & other == "no") |
         (afam == "no" & hispanic == "no" & other == "yes"))

fertility_chunk_plot <- fertility_chunk_modified %>%
  mutate(ethnicity = case_when(
    afam == "yes" ~ "afam",
    hispanic == "yes" ~ "hispanic",
    other == "yes" ~ "other"
  )) %>%
  group_by(ethnicity) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(n))

gf_col(count ~ ethnicity, data = fertility_chunk_plot, fill = ~ ethnicity) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Which Ethnic Groups are More Likely to Want More Children?",
          x = "Ethnicity",
          y = "Number of Mothers")%>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Ethnic Group",palette = "Pastel1"))

```

## 2. Does a Mother’s Age Relate to How Many Hours She Works, and Does Wanting More Children Make a Difference?

```{r}
fertility_modified3 <- fertility_modified %>%
  group_by(age, morekids) %>%
  summarize(avg_work = mean(work, na.rm = TRUE))

gf_col(avg_work ~ age, fill = ~morekids, data = fertility_modified3, position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Average Work Hours vs Age by Desire for More Kids",
          x = "Age of Mother",
          y = "Average Hours Worked per Week") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Want More Kids", palette = "Paired"))
```

## 3. Are Mothers Who Want More Kids Generally Younger or Older Than Those Who Don’t?

```{r}
fertility_chunk_modified2 <- fertility_modified %>%
  gf_boxplot(age ~ morekids,fill = ~morekids) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Desire For More Kids", palette = "PiYG")) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Are Mothers Who Want More Kids Younger or Older?",
    x = "Desire For More Kids", y = "Age of Mother"
  )
fertility_chunk_modified2
```

## 4. How Does The Distribution Of Weekly Work Hours Vary Based On The Gender Of The First-Born Child?

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ work | gender1, data = fertility_modified, binwidth = 5, fill = "#c885da") %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Work Hours Distribution by Gender of First Born",
          x = "Hours Worked per Week",
          y = "Count")

```

# 6. *Summary of Findings*

From the data and the graphs plotted, it is evident that

1.  African American women are most likely to want more children, compared to women of other ethnicity.

2.  Younger mothers work for fewer hours than older women, perhaps because they have just started working, or they are prioritizing family.

3.  Women who work for longer hours in a week tend not to want more children.

4.  In the box plot, we see that the IQR for the 'no' plot has wider variation as compared to the 'yes', suggesting that women of a wide range of ages do not prefer having children.

5.  Most mothers either do not work at all, or work around 50 hours per week.

6.  Whether the first born child is male or female, it does not seem to effect the working hours of the mother.

# 7. *Surprising Aspects*

1.  According to the U.S. Census and CDC fertility data, Hispanic families are usually bigger than African American families, both in terms of fertility rates and household size. So, I was surprised to see that African American mothers desire having more kids than Hispanic mothers.

2.  I was not expecting such a gradual rise for the 2nd chart. I thought that older women who work over 15 hours a week would prefer not having more children.

3.  There are very few young mothers, under the age of 24 who want more children. It is evident from the outliers in the box plot.

4.  Only few mothers are into part-time jobs. I assumed that most of the mothers would prefer part-time over full-time jobs.
