# Horror Movies

Studying Top-Rated Horror Movies

EXPERIMENT OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this experiment could be to study how horror movies affect their audience in terms of heart rate, HRV, etc and compare them to ratings, reviews and movie characteristics.



## *1. Setting up R Packages*

```{r}
# SETUP CHUNK- LIBRARIES
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic) # Our all-in-one package
library(skimr) # Looking at data
library(janitor) # Clean the data
library(naniar) # Handle missing data
library(visdat) # Visualise missing data
library(tinytable) # Printing Static Tables for our data
library(DT) # Interactive Tables for our data
library(crosstable) # Multiple variable summaries
```

## 2. *Read Data*

```{r}
horrormovies_modified <- horrormovies <- readr::read_csv("../data/HorrorMoviedata.csv")%>%
  # Clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names(case="snake")
horrormovies_modified
```

## 3. *Examine Data*

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(horrormovies_modified)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(horrormovies_modified)
```

```{r}
crosstable(ranking + hrv_difference_percent ~ this_film_is_a_sequel + this_film_has_at_least_one_sequel,
  data = horrormovies_modified
) %>%
  crosstable::as_flextable()
```

```{r}
crosstable(scare_score + rotten_tomato_score ~ this_film_is_a_sequel,
  data = horrormovies_modified
) %>%
  crosstable::as_flextable()
```

# 4. *Data Dictionary*

## *Quantitative Data*

1.  ranking(dbl): Overall ranking of the movie
2.  avg_resting_heart_rate_bpm(dbl): Average heart rate of audience while at rest (bpm)
3.  avg_movie_heart_rate_bpm(dbl): Average heart rate of audience while watching the movie (bpm)
4.  overall_difference_bpm(dbl): Difference between average movie heart rate and average resting heart rate (bpm)
5.  hrv_difference_percent(dbl): Change in heart rate variability (hrv) from resting state to watching the movie (%)
6.  highest_spike_bpm(dbl): The highest heart rate of the audience during the movie (bpm)
7.  scare_score(dbl): How scary the movie was (out of 100)
8.  rotten_tomato_score(dbl): Rotten tomato's score of the movie (out of 100)
9.  year(dbl): The year the movie was released

## *Qualitative Data*

1.  movie(fct): Name of the movie
2.  this_film_is_a_sequel(fct): Asks if the movie is a sequel (yes or no)
3.  this_film_has_at_least_one_sequel(fct): Asks if the movie has a sequel (yes or no)

```{r}
horrormovies_modified %>%
  dplyr::count(movie,this_film_is_a_sequel,this_film_has_at_least_one_sequel) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
horrormovies_modified %>%
  dplyr::summarise(across(
    .cols = c(avg_resting_heart_rate_bpm,avg_movie_heart_rate_bpm,overall_difference_bpm,hrv_difference_percent,highest_spike_bpm,scare_score,rotten_tomato_score), # select columns

    .fns = list(
      mean = ~ mean(., na.rm = T),
      sd = sd,
      min = min, max = max
    )
  ))
```

```{r}
horrormovies_modified <- horrormovies %>% tidyr::drop_na()
horrormovies_modified
```

```{r}
horrormovies_modified <- horrormovies %>%
  mutate(
    movie = as.factor(movie),
    this_film_is_a_sequel = as.factor(this_film_is_a_sequel),
    this_film_has_at_least_one_sequel = as.factor(this_film_has_at_least_one_sequel)
  ) %>%

  # arrange the Qual variables first, Quant next
  dplyr::relocate(where(is.factor), .after = ranking)

glimpse(horrormovies_modified)
```

```{r}
horrormovies_modified2 <- horrormovies_modified %>%
  stats::setNames(c("Ranking","Movie","This Film is a Sequel","This Film Has at Least One Sequel","Average Resting Heart Rate (bpm)","Average Movie Heart Rate (bpm)","Overall Difference (bpm)","Heart Rate Variabilty (Difference %)","Highest Spike (bpm)","Scare Score","Rotten Tomato Score","Year of Release"))

horrormovies_modified2 %>%
  DT::datatable(
    style = "default",
    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = "caption-side: top; text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 100%;", "Horror Movies Dataset (Clean)"
    ),
    options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  DT::formatStyle(
    columns = names(horrormovies_modified2),
    fontFamily = "Roboto Condensed",
    fontSize = "12px"
  )
```

# 5. *Graphs*

## 1. Do Sequels Trigger Different Audience Reactions Compared to Non-Sequels?

```{r}
horrormovies_long <- horrormovies_modified2 %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`Overall Difference (bpm)`, `Highest Spike (bpm)`, `Scare Score`, `Average Movie Heart Rate (bpm)`),
    names_to = "measure",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# Create the box plot with facets
horrormovies_plot <- horrormovies_long %>%
  gf_boxplot(value ~ `This Film is a Sequel`, fill = ~ `This Film is a Sequel`) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Is it a Sequel?", palette = "Accent")) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y") %>%   # one box plot per numeric variable
  gf_labs(
    title = "Audience Reactions: Sequels vs Non-Sequels",
    x = "Is This Film a Sequel?",
    y = "Value of Measure"
  )

horrormovies_plot

```

## 2. Do Movies That Critics Rate More Highly Also Tend To Be Scarier For Audiences?

```{r}

gf_point(`Scare Score` ~ `Rotten Tomato Score`, data = horrormovies_modified2, color = 'maroon', size = 2) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Do Higher Critic Ratings Correlate With Scarier Movies?",
          x = "Rotten Tomatoes Score",
          y = "Audience Scare Score")

```

## 3. Do Newer Movies Differ From Older Ones In How Much They Raise BPM?

```{r}

horrormovies_plot2 <- horrormovies_modified %>%
  gf_col(overall_difference_bpm ~ factor(year), fill = ~this_film_is_a_sequel, position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Do Newer Movies Differ From Older Ones In How Much They Raise BPM?",
          x = "Movie Release Year",
          y = "Average BPM Raised",
          fill = "Legend = Is it a Sequel?") %>%
  gf_theme(theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)))


horrormovies_plot2


```



# 6. *Summary of Findings*

From the data and the graphs plotted, it is evident that

1. Heart rates of the audience tend to be slightly higher for non-sequels compared to sequels.

2. Both sequels and non-sequels can cause strong spikes.

3. Non- sequels tend to be scarier than sequels.

4. Newer movies tend to have sequels as compared to older movies.

5. People who watch newer movies tend to have a higher average bpm than people who watch older movies.


# 7. *Surprising Aspects*

1. A movie's Rotten Tomato rating does not completely predict how scary the movie is, because there is a wide variation in the scare scores whether the movie was rated highly or poorly.

2. Some movies that received almost perfect ratings are only moderately scary compared to movies that are considered mediocre. This suggests that the scare factor is subjective.

3. Movies that are not sequels are scarier than movies that are.
