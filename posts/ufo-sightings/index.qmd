# UFO Sightings

Studying UFO Encounters

EXPERIMENT OBJECTIVE:

This aim of this experiment could be to document UFOs and their characteristics spotted in the USA, Great Britain, Australia and Canada over the years.

## *1. Setting up R Packages*

```{r}
# SETUP CHUNK- LIBRARIES
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic) # Our all-in-one package
library(skimr) # Looking at data
library(janitor) # Clean the data
library(naniar) # Handle missing data
library(visdat) # Visualise missing data
library(tinytable) # Printing Static Tables for our data
library(DT) # Interactive Tables for our data
library(crosstable) # Multiple variable summaries
```

## 2. *Read Data*

```{r}
ufo_modified <- ufo <- readr::read_csv("../data/ufo_sightings.csv") %>% 
  # Clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names(case="snake")
ufo_modified
```

## 3. *Examine Data*

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(ufo_modified)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(ufo_modified)
```

## 4. *Data Dictionary*

### *Quantitative Data*

1.  encounter_length(dbl): Duration of encounter with UFO (seconds)
2.  latitude(dbl): Latitude of UFO location
3.  longitude(dbl): Longitude of UFO location

### *Qualitative Data*

1.  date_time(fct): Date and time when the UFO was spotted
2.  city_area(fct): Where the UFO was spotted
3.  state(fct): State code where the UFO was spotted
4.  country(fct): Country in which the UFO was spotted
5.  ufo_shape(fct): Shape of the UFO
6.  described_encounter_length(fct): Duration of encounter with UFO (seconds, minutes and hours)
7.  description(fct): Description and details regarding the encounter
8.  date_documented(fct): The date when the sighting was officially recorded

```{r}
ufo_modified %>%
  dplyr::summarise(across(
    .cols = c(encounter_length,latitude,longitude), # select columns

    .fns = list(
      mean = ~ mean(., na.rm = T),
      sd = sd,
      min = min, max = max
    )
  ))
```

```{r}
ufo_modified <- ufo %>% tidyr::drop_na()
ufo_modified
```

```{r}
ufo_modified <- ufo_modified %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) %>% 
  relocate(where(is.factor))
glimpse(ufo_modified)
```

```{r}
ufo_modified2 <- ufo_modified %>%
  stats::setNames(c("Date_and_Time_of_Sighting","City_Area","State_Code","Country","UFO_Shape","Described_Encounter_Length","Description","Date_of_Documentation","Encounter_Length","Latitude","Longitude"))

ufo_modified2 %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 500) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    style = "default",
    caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = "caption-side: top; text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 100%;", "UFO Sightings Dataset (Clean)"
    ),
    options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  DT::formatStyle(
    columns = names(ufo_modified2),
    fontFamily = "Roboto Condensed",
    fontSize = "15px",
  )
```

# 5. *Graphs*

## 1. Which Countries Have Reported the Most UFO Sightings?

```{r}
ufo_modified2 %>%
  gf_bar(~Country,
    fill = "#ffbd59", position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Which Countries Have Reported the Most UFO Sightings?",
          x = "Country",
          y = "Number of Sightings") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2"))
```

## 2. How Has The Length of UFO Encounters Evolved Over Time?

```{r}
gf_point(Encounter_Length ~ Date_of_Documentation, 
         data = ufo_modified2, 
         color = '#0097b2', 
         size = 1) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "How Has The Length of UFO Encounters Evolved Over Time?",
          x = "Date Documented",
          y = "Encounter Length (seconds,log scale)") %>% 
  gf_refine(scale_y_log10())

```

## 3. Does UFO Encounter Duration Differ Across Countries?

```{r}
ufo_modified2 %>%
  gf_boxplot(Encounter_Length ~ Country, fill = ~Country, orientation = "x",alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_y_log10(), scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Countries",palette = "Set1")) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Does UFO Encounter Duration Differ Across Countries?",
    x = "Country", y = "Encounter Duration"
  )

```

## 4. What is The Most Frequently Sighted UFO Shape?

```{r}
ufo_modified2 %>%
  gf_bar(~UFO_Shape, fill = ~Country, position = "dodge",) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_y_log10(), scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend = Countries",palette = "Set1")) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "What is The Most Frequently Sighted UFO Shape?",
          x = "UFO Shape",
          y = "Count") %>%
  gf_theme(theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)))

```


# 6. *Summary of Findings*

1. The USA has reported the most UFO sightings over the years, next being Canada.

2. Encounter duration with UFOs has remained almost the same over the years, with a few exceptions.

3. UFO encounters in Great Britain tend to be the longest as compared to Australia, Canada and USA.

4. Duration of UFO encounters varies widely in USA, and very scarcely in Australia. 

5. The most frequently sighted UFO Shape is 'light'. This particularly shaped UFO was spotted in all four countries on varied days.

6. The lesser frequently sighted UFO Shapes include 'changed', 'crescent', 'flare', 'hexagon' and 'pyramid'.



# 7. *Surprising Aspects*

1. Why are there more UFOs spotted in USA? Could they be mistaking objects as UFOs?

2. According to the data set, there are UFO sightings that were documented only years after they were reported, which is very strange.

3. Duration of UFO encounters seem to be higher in the Northern countries.

4. I was unaware of the variety in shapes of UFOs that existed.
